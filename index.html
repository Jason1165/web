<br><h2>The Pieces</h2>
<p>On the board there are a total of 6 unique pieces which move differently.
<br>The pawn can only move foward and kills diagonally by one square.
<br>The rook can only move vertically and horizontally.
<br>The bishop can only move diagonally.
<br>The knight moves in a L shape and can jump over pieces.
<br>The queen can move any spaces in each direction.
<br>The king can only move one space in each direction. </p>

<h2>Checkmate</h2>
<p>A checkmate occurs when the king is unable to move anywhere without being attack by an opponents piece or cannot prevent the attack.
<br>The most common kind is a king being trapped by three pieces that attack vertically or horizontally (rook and queen). </p>

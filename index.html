<h2>The Board</h2>
<p>The board consists of 64 spaces and usually have alternating colors of black and white.
The board should be set up <a href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/how-to-set-up-a-chessboard">like this<a/> 
with the queen matching the color of the square.</p>

<br><h2>The Pieces</h2>
<p>On the board there are a total of 6 <a href= "https://www.ichess.net/blog/chess-pieces-moves/">unique pieces</a> which move differently.
<br>The pawn can only move foward and kills diagonally by one square.
<br>The rook can only move vertically and horizontally.
<br>The bishop can only move diagonally.
<br>The knight moves in a L shape and can jump over pieces.
<br>The queen can move any spaces in each direction.
<br>The king can only move one space in each direction. </p>
<br><h2>Checkmate</h2>
<p>A<a href= "https://www.chess.com/terms/checkmate-chess">checkmate</a> occurs when the king is unable to move anywhere without being attack by an opponents piece or cannot prevent the attack.
<br>The most common kind is a king being trapped by three pieces that attack vertically or horizontally (rook and queen). </p>
